# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for A250: American History Shorts

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This PRD outlines the vision, goals, and technical requirements for A250, a project to create 250 cinematic, 60-second videos that educate and engage U.S. students about American history and the Bill of Rights. These videos will be designed for TikTok and other social platforms, optimized for sharing, stitching, and dueting, with a goal of reaching 10 million students by July 4, 2027.

### 1.2 Background
Two-thirds of U.S. eighth-graders cannot name a single right in the First Amendment (NAEP 2024). With misinformation rampant on social media, there's an urgent need to make history relevant and engaging where students already spend their time. Inspired by Canada's Heritage Minutes, A250 will modernize historical storytelling with Hollywood-quality scripts, interactive elements, and viral potential.

### 1.3 Goals
- **Educational Impact**: Teach students what the Bill of Rights says and why it matters to their lives.
- **Engagement**: Create fun, shareable content that students want to post, stitch, or duet.
- **Reach**: Achieve 10 million student interactions by July 4, 2027.
- **Accessibility**: Provide free lesson packs for teachers to integrate into classrooms with no prep required.

## 2. Target Audience
- **Primary**: U.S. students aged 13-18, active on TikTok and other short-form video platforms.
- **Secondary**: Teachers and educators looking for engaging history content.
- **Tertiary**: General social media users who may share or interact with the content virally.

## 3. Key Features

- **Scripting**: Written by Hollywood writers or AI-generated with human oversight to ensure quality and emotional impact.
- **Shareability**: Designed with clear hooks for stitching and dueting (e.g., open-ended questions or challenges at the end of videos).

### 3.2 Interactive Elements
- **Polls and Debates**: Embedded or follow-up content allowing users to vote on issues like "Speech vs. Censorship" in real-time.
- **Call-to-Action**: Prompts encouraging users to share their own stories or opinions related to the historical theme.

### 3.3 Educational Resources

- **Cross-Platform**: Adaptable for Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and other platforms.
- **Analytics**: Track engagement metrics (views, shares, stitches, duets) to measure progress toward the 10 million interaction goal.

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 Video Generation on Hugging Face
- **Tooling**: Leverage Hugging Face models for AI-driven video generation, scriptwriting, or voiceovers. Explore models like text-to-video, text-to-speech, or animation tools available on the platform.
- **Customization**: Fine-tune models to produce cinematic visuals and dialogue that resonate with a teen audience.
- **Workflow**: Develop a pipeline for scripting, generating, editing, and exporting videos directly from Hugging Face or integrated tools.
- **Quality**: Ensure output meets TikTok's resolution and format standards (1080x1920, MP4).

### 4.2 Content Management
- **Database**: Store scripts, video assets, and metadata for 250 stories in a structured format for easy retrieval and iteration.
- **Versioning**: Track changes to scripts and videos to allow for updates based on feedback or trends.

### 4.3 Distribution
- **Automated Posting**: Set up APIs or scripts to upload videos to TikTok and other platforms with appropriate hashtags and descriptions.
- **Scheduling**: Plan a release calendar to maintain consistent engagement (e.g., 1-2 videos per week).

## 5. Success Metrics
- **Engagement**: 10 million student interactions (posts, stitches, duets) by July 4, 2027.
- **Educational Reach**: Distribution of lesson packs to at least 5,000 teachers or schools.
- **Viral Impact**: At least 50 videos achieving over 1 million views each.
- **Feedback**: Positive sentiment in comments and user-generated content related to A250 videos.

## 6. Constraints and Assumptions
- **Constraints**: Limited budget for initial production; reliance on AI tools for cost-effective scaling. Need to comply with TikTok's community guidelines and copyright laws for historical imagery or music.
- **Assumptions**: Hugging Face provides sufficient tools or models for video generation. Teens will engage with history content if presented in a fun, relatable format.

## 7. Timeline (High-Level)
- **Phase 1 (1-2 Months)**: Research Hugging Face capabilities, draft initial scripts, and prototype 5-10 videos.
- **Phase 2 (3-6 Months)**: Refine production pipeline, release first 50 videos, and gather feedback.
- **Phase 3 (6-18 Months)**: Scale to 250 videos, launch teacher resources, and push for viral growth.
- **Phase 4 (18-36 Months)**: Optimize based on analytics, expand partnerships, and hit 10 million interactions by July 4, 2027.

## 8. Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk 1**: AI-generated content lacks emotional depth or cultural relevance.  
  **Mitigation**: Involve human writers or editors to polish scripts and visuals.
- **Risk 2**: Low engagement on TikTok due to algorithm changes.  
  **Mitigation**: Experiment with trends, hashtags, and influencer partnerships to boost visibility.
- **Risk 3**: Educational content perceived as "boring" by students.  
  **Mitigation**: Prioritize humor, drama, and interactivity in video design.

## 9. Next Steps
- Finalize PRD and align on vision with stakeholders.
- Begin research into Hugging Face models for video and script generation.
- Develop a small batch of test scripts to validate the concept.
