# Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Serverless Endpoint for Lightricks/LTX-Video on Amazon SageMaker

This guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step process for deploying the **Lightricks/LTX-Video** model (a text-to-video generation model available on Hugging Face) as a serverless inference endpoint on Amazon SageMaker. The serverless inference option is ideal for workloads with intermittent or unpredictable traffic patterns, offering cost efficiency and automatic scaling without the need to manage infrastructure. The guide assumes you have an AWS account, basic familiarity with Python, and access to SageMaker Studio or a SageMaker Notebook Instance.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

1. **AWS Account**:
   - Active AWS account with permissions for SageMaker, S3, IAM, and ECR.
   - IAM role with `AmazonSageMakerFullAccess` and `AmazonS3FullAccess` policies. Note the role ARN (e.g., `arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/SageMakerExecutionRole`).

2. **SageMaker Setup**:
   - Access to SageMaker Studio or a SageMaker Notebook Instance.
   - If using SageMaker Studio, set up a domain in the desired region (e.g., `us-east-1`).
   - Recommended kernel: `conda_pytorch_p310` or `Python 3 (Data Science)`.

3. **Python Environment**:
   - Python 3.8+ installed.
   - Install required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install --upgrade sagemaker boto3 diffusers torch
     ```

4. **Hugging Face Account**:
   - Access to the Hugging Face Hub (https://huggingface.co).
   - Optional: Hugging Face token for private models (not required for Lightricks/LTX-Video if publicly accessible).

5. **Model Information**:
   - Model: `Lightricks/LTX-Video` (available on Hugging Face Hub).
   - Library: `diffusers` (used for text-to-video generation).
   - Hardware: Requires GPU (e.g., `ml.g5.2xlarge` for testing; serverless supports up to 6GB memory).

6. **AWS Region**:
   - Ensure the region supports SageMaker Serverless Inference (e.g., `us-east-1`, `us-west-2`, `eu-west-1`). Check AWS Regional Services List for availability.[](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/serverless-endpoints.html)

---

## Step 1: Set Up Your SageMaker Environment

1. **Access SageMaker Studio or Notebook Instance**:
   - **SageMaker Studio**:
     - Navigate to the AWS Management Console > SageMaker > Studio.
     - Create or open an existing domain in a supported region (e.g., `us-east-1`).
     - Launch a JupyterLab instance with the `Python 3 (Data Science)` kernel.
   - **SageMaker Notebook Instance**:
     - Create a notebook instance (e.g., `ml.t3.medium`) with the `conda_pytorch_p310` kernel.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - In a notebook cell, run:
     ```bash
     !pip install --upgrade sagemaker boto3 diffusers torch
     ```

3. **Configure IAM Role**:
   - Ensure your SageMaker execution role has the necessary permissions:
     - `AmazonSageMakerFullAccess`
     - `AmazonS3FullAccess`
     - `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess` (for custom containers, if needed)
   - Retrieve the role ARN from the IAM console (e.g., `arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/SageMakerExecutionRole`).

4. **Set Up S3 Bucket**:
   - Create an S3 bucket for storing model artifacts and outputs (e.g., `sagemaker-<your-name>-<region>`).
   - Note the bucket name for later use.

---

## Step 2: Prepare the Lightricks/LTX-Video Model

The `Lightricks/LTX-Video` model is a text-to-video model built on the `diffusers` library. SageMaker’s Hugging Face Deep Learning Containers (DLCs) support `diffusers`, making it straightforward to deploy.

1. **Verify Model Compatibility**:
   - Visit the model page on Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video.
   - Confirm it uses `diffusers` and check hardware requirements (typically requires GPU with at least 16GB VRAM for inference).
   - Note: Serverless Inference supports up to 6GB memory, which may require model quantization (e.g., `torch.float16`) to fit.

2. **Test Model Locally (Optional)**:
   - To ensure compatibility, test the model in a SageMaker notebook:
     ```python
     from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
     import torch

     model_id = "Lightricks/LTX-Video"
     pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
     pipe = pipe.to("cuda")
     prompt = "A cat playing piano"
     video_frames = pipe(prompt).frames
     print(f"Generated {len(video_frames)} frames")
     ```
   - If the model runs successfully, proceed. If memory issues arise, ensure quantization (`torch.float16`) is applied.

3. **Package Model Artifacts (Optional)**:
   - If you need to fine-tune or modify the model, package it as a `model.tar.gz` file and upload to S3:
     ```bash
     tar -czvf model.tar.gz -C <model_directory> .
     aws s3 cp model.tar.gz s3://<your-bucket>/models/ltx-video/
     ```
   - For direct Hub usage, SageMaker can load the model from Hugging Face, so this step is typically unnecessary.

---

## Step 3: Create a SageMaker Model

1. **Define Model Configuration**:
   - Use the Hugging Face DLC for PyTorch, which includes `diffusers`.
   - Specify the model ID and task for SageMaker to load from Hugging Face Hub.

2. **Sample Code**:
   - In a SageMaker notebook, run the following to create the model:
     ```python
     import sagemaker
     from sagemaker.huggingface import HuggingFaceModel
     import boto3

     # AWS setup
     role = "arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/SageMakerExecutionRole"  # Replace with your role ARN
     region = boto3.Session().region_name
     session = sagemaker.Session()
     bucket = session.default_bucket()

     # Model configuration
     model_id = "Lightricks/LTX-Video"
     hub = {
         "HF_MODEL_ID": model_id,
         "HF_TASK": "text-to-video"
     }

     # Create Hugging Face model
     huggingface_model = HuggingFaceModel(
         env=hub,
         role=role,
         image_uri=sagemaker.image_uris.retrieve(
             framework="huggingface",
             region=region,
             version="4.37.0",
             image_scope="inference",
             base_framework_version="pytorch2.1.0"
         )
     )
     ```

   - **Notes**:
     - Replace `<account-id>` with your AWS account ID.
     - The `image_uri` retrieves the latest Hugging Face DLC for PyTorch, compatible with `diffusers`.
     - The `hub` dictionary tells SageMaker to load `Lightricks/LTX-Video` from Hugging Face Hub.

---

## Step 4: Create a Serverless Endpoint Configuration

Serverless Inference requires an endpoint configuration specifying memory and concurrency settings.

1. **Define Serverless Configuration**:
   - Memory options: 1024, 2048, 3072, 4096, 5120, or 6144 MB.
   - Max concurrency: Up to 200 (adjust based on expected traffic).
   - Optional: Provisioned concurrency for reduced cold starts (e.g., 10).

2. **Sample Code**:
   - Add the following to your notebook to create the endpoint configuration:
     ```python
     import boto3
     sm_client = boto3.client("sagemaker")

     endpoint_config_name = "ltx-video-serverless-epc"
     response = sm_client.create_endpoint_config(
         EndpointConfigName=endpoint_config_name,
         ProductionVariants=[
             {
                 "ModelName": huggingface_model.name,  # Automatically generated model name
                 "VariantName": "AllTraffic",
                 "ServerlessConfig": {
                     "MemorySizeInMB": 6144,  # Maximum for serverless
                     "MaxConcurrency": 10
                 }
             }
         ]
     )
     print(f"Endpoint Config ARN: {response['EndpointConfigArn']}")
     ```

   - **Notes**:
     - Use 6144 MB to accommodate the model’s memory needs (adjust based on testing).
     - Set `MaxConcurrency` to 10 for moderate traffic; increase for higher loads.
     - Provisioned concurrency is omitted for cost savings but can be added if cold starts are an issue (e.g., `"ProvisionedConcurrency": 5`).

---

## Step 5: Deploy the Serverless Endpoint

1. **Create the Endpoint**:
   - Deploy the model using the endpoint configuration.
   - Sample code:
     ```python
     endpoint_name = "ltx-video-serverless-endpoint"
     response = sm_client.create_endpoint(
         EndpointName=endpoint_name,
         EndpointConfigName=endpoint_config_name
     )
     print(f"Endpoint ARN: {response['EndpointArn']}")

     # Wait for endpoint to be in service
     waiter = sm_client.get_waiter("endpoint_in_service")
     waiter.wait(EndpointName=endpoint_name)
     print(f"Endpoint {endpoint_name} is now in service")
     ```

2. **Deployment Time**:
   - Serverless endpoint creation may take 5–10 minutes due to resource provisioning.
   - Monitor status in the SageMaker console (Inference > Endpoints).

---

## Step 6: Run Inference on the Endpoint

1. **Invoke the Endpoint**:
   - Send a text prompt to generate a video.
   - Sample code:
     ```python
     import json
     sm_runtime = boto3.client("sagemaker-runtime")

     prompt = "A cat playing piano"
     payload = {"inputs": prompt}
     response = sm_runtime.invoke_endpoint(
         EndpointName=endpoint_name,
         ContentType="application/json",
         Body=json.dumps(payload)
     )
     result = json.loads(response["Body"].read().decode())
     video_frames = result.get("frames", [])
     print(f"Generated {len(video_frames)} frames")
     ```

2. **Save Video Output**:
   - Use `diffusers.utils.export_to_video` to convert frames to a video file:
     ```python
     from diffusers.utils import export_to_video

     video_path = "cat_piano.mp4"
     export_to_video(video_frames, video_path)
     print(f"Video saved to {video_path}")
     ```

3. **Upload to S3 (Optional)**:
   - Store the video in S3 for access:
     ```bash
     aws s3 cp cat_piano.mp4 s3://<your-bucket>/outputs/
     ```

---

## Step 7: Optimize and Monitor

1. **Optimize Performance**:
   - **Quantization**: Use `torch.float16` to reduce memory usage, as shown in Step 2.
   - **Memory Size**: Test lower memory sizes (e.g., 4096 MB) to reduce costs if 6144 MB is excessive. Benchmark using the SageMaker Serverless Inference Benchmarking Toolkit.[](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-the-amazon-sagemaker-serverless-inference-benchmarking-toolkit/)
   - **Provisioned Concurrency**: Add provisioned concurrency (e.g., 5–10) to minimize cold starts for latency-sensitive applications.[](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/serverless-endpoints.html)

2. **Monitor Endpoint**:
   - Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor invocation latency, errors, and costs.
   - Enable SageMaker Model Monitoring for performance tracking.
   - Check logs in CloudWatch under `/aws/sagemaker/Endpoints/<endpoint_name>`.

3. **Cost Management**:
   - Serverless Inference is billed per millisecond of compute time and data processed. Review costs in AWS Cost Explorer.
   - Delete unused endpoints to avoid charges (see Step 8).

---

## Step 8: Clean Up Resources

To avoid incurring costs, delete the endpoint, endpoint configuration, and model when done.

1. **Delete Endpoint**:
   ```python
   sm_client.delete_endpoint(EndpointName=endpoint_name)
   print(f"Deleted endpoint: {endpoint_name}")
   ```

2. **Delete Endpoint Configuration**:
   ```python
   sm_client.delete_endpoint_config(EndpointConfigName=endpoint_config_name)
   print(f"Deleted endpoint config: {endpoint_config_name}")
   ```

3. **Delete Model**:
   ```python
   sm_client.delete_model(ModelName=huggingface_model.name)
   print(f"Deleted model: {huggingface_model.name}")
   ```

4. **Verify in Console**:
   - Check the SageMaker console (Inference > Endpoints, Endpoint Configurations, Models) to ensure resources are removed.
   - Empty the S3 bucket if no longer needed:
     ```bash
     aws s3 rm s3://<your-bucket>/ --recursive
     ```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Endpoint Creation Fails**:
  - Check CloudWatch logs for errors (e.g., `/aws/sagemaker/Endpoints/<endpoint_name>`).
  - Ensure the SageMaker Python SDK and boto3 are updated:
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade sagemaker boto3
    ```
  - Verify the IAM role has required permissions.[](https://repost.aws/questions/QULRy50Vd7SW6KT0MMzk4NeQ/how-to-create-a-serverless-endpoint-in-sagemaker)

- **Memory Issues**:
  - If the model exceeds 6GB, apply quantization (`torch.float16`) or use a real-time endpoint with a larger instance (e.g., `ml.g5.2xlarge`).
  - Test with smaller memory sizes (e.g., 4096 MB) to find the optimal configuration.[](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-the-amazon-sagemaker-serverless-inference-benchmarking-toolkit/)

- **Cold Starts**:
  - Serverless endpoints may experience cold starts (seconds of latency) after idle periods. Add provisioned concurrency to reduce this.[](https://www.infoq.com/news/2022/05/sagemaker-serverless-aws/)

- **Inference Errors**:
  - Ensure the payload format matches the model’s expectations (e.g., `{"inputs": "<prompt>"}`).
  - Check model card for specific input requirements.

---

## Best Practices

- **Cost Efficiency**: Use serverless for intermittent traffic. For high-throughput workloads, consider real-time endpoints with GPUs.[](https://medium.com/picus-security-engineering/customized-model-serving-via-aws-sagemaker-serverless-inference-a72879948321)
- **Security**: Use AWS KMS keys to encrypt model artifacts and endpoint data. Specify a KMS key in the endpoint configuration if needed.[](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/serverless-endpoints-create-config.html)
- **Scalability**: Set `MaxConcurrency` based on expected traffic. Monitor and adjust using Application Auto Scaling if needed.[](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/serverless-endpoints.html)
- **Testing**: Test inference in a notebook before deploying to catch issues early.
- **Documentation**: Refer to the model card (https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video) for prompt guidelines and output formats.

## Notes

- **Model Size**: The `Lightricks/LTX-Video` model may require quantization to fit within the 6GB memory limit of SageMaker Serverless Inference. If it exceeds this, consider real-time inference with a GPU instance.
- **Cold Starts**: Be aware of potential cold starts (seconds of latency) for serverless endpoints. Test with provisioned concurrency for latency-sensitive applications.
- **Regional Availability**: Verify that your region supports SageMaker Serverless Inference. If unavailable, switch to a supported region (e.g., `us-east-1`).[](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/serverless-endpoints.html)

By following this guide, you can deploy the `Lightricks/LTX-Video` model as a cost-effective, scalable serverless endpoint on SageMaker, ready to generate videos from text prompts. If you encounter issues or need customization (e.g., fine-tuning, specific video formats), please provide details for further assistance!
